*In this system, we're trapped
Numbers dictate our fate, we're mapped
A student's worth, they say
Is in their GPA, day by day*

*But I see beyond the digits
The limitations they impose, the limits
Of what we can achieve, how we grow
Reducing us to a mere score, so low*

**We are more than just grades
Our potential cannot be measured in shades
Of A's or B's or C's or D's
We are complex, diverse, and unique as trees

**So let us break free from this illusion
Of a rigid, narrow, academic conclusion
Let us strive for knowledge, not for marks
And reach for the stars, through the dark**

**For in the end, it is not our GPA
That will define us, come what may
It is our spirit, our drive, our passion
That will lead us to a life of satisfaction.**
